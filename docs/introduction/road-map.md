Since the validator is a large project, we broke it down into individual core components:

- `Gossip`: The entry point of the network where nodes discover other nodes, share metadata about what ports are open, etc.
- `AccountsDB`: An optimized database to represent the state of the blockchain at a specific slot, including the state of all the accounts.
- `Turbine`: The networking protocol that distributes blocks throughout the cluster as shreds.
- `Repair`: Detects which shreds are missing and requests them from other nodes in the cluster
- `Ledger`: A database that stores every transaction from every block and the results of executing those transactions.
- `SVM/Runtime` (Solana Virtual Machine): An execution environment that updates on-chain accounts by processing transactions with on-chain programs.
- `TowerBFT`: A consensus protocol that manages votes and forks to know the head of the chain.
- `Replay`: Executes transactions from recent blocks to validate them, vote on them, and update AccountsDB.
- `RPC`: Responsible for serving on-chain data to other clients using remote-procedure calls including account balances, transaction statuses, and more.
- `Proof-of-History`: A proof of the passage of time using a verifiable delay function at the heart of consensus.
- `TPU - Block Production` (Transaction Processing Unit): Find the optimal transaction ordering to pack into a block based on specific read/write locks and priority fees.
