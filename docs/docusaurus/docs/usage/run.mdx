To get a full list of commands and options, run the following command:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/sig --help
```

The binary located at `./zig-out/bin/sig` will be abbreviated to `sig` in the rest of this document.

## Validator

Startup the validator with the following command:

```bash
sig validator
```

*Note:* this command is modified as more validator components are completed.

## Identity

Sig stores its private key in `~/.sig/identity.key`.
On its first run, Sig will automatically generate a key if no key exists.
To see the public key, use the `identity` subcommand.

```bash
sig identity
```

## Gossip

To run Sig as a Solana gossip client, use the `gossip` subcommand.
- Specify entrypoints to connect to a cluster using `-e` or use pre-defined entrypoints with
the `-n` option, followed by the network you are connecting to.
- Optionally use `-p` to specify a custom listening port (default is 8001).

For more info about gossip, see the [readme](https://github.com/Syndica/sig/tree/main/src/gossip#readme).

```bash
sig gossip -n <NETWORK>
```

where `<NETWORK>` is either `mainnet`, `devnet`, or `testnet`.

or

```bash
sig gossip -p <PORT> --entrypoint <IP>:<PORT>
```

## AccountsDB

We also support a few accounts-db related commands.

### Download a snapshot

You can download a snapshot from the network:

```bash
sig download_snapshot \
    # where to save snapshot
    -s test_data/tmp \
    # use default testnet entrypoints for gossip
    -n testnet \
    # pubkeys of validators who you trust
    --trusted-validator 3gxDv5XbkkXUiqKiqt5WbsfGN7i9GHB1xMWBqhg4UDzj \
    # minimum MB/s speed when downloading snapshot
    --min-snapshot-download-speed 50
```

Note: we dont support downloading genesis files, however they can be found
in `data/genesis-files/` in the repo.

### Validate a snapshot

You can also validate an existing snapshot:

```bash
sig snapshot-validate \
    # path to snapshot
    -s test_data/tmp \
    # validate against the genesis file for testnet
    -n testnet \
    # stream the accounts out of the snapshot (see the geyser readme to know how to read from the stream)
    --enable-geyser \
    # save the index generated for faster loads in the future (use --fastload in future runs)
    --save-index \
    # preallocate some accounts to increase the speed of the snapshot validation
    --accounts-per-file-estimate 500
```

`Note:` if you are running out-of-memory when loading, you can either reduce the preallocations
using a smaller value for `--accounts-per-file-estimate` or use `--use-disk-index` to use disk memory
instead of RAM.

`Note:` you can also define a specifc genesis file to validate against using `-g`.

### Collect Shreds

You can also connect to the network and collect shreds:

```bash
sig shred-network \
    # collect shreds from testnet
    -n testnet \
    # dont re-transmit the shreds in the turbine-tree (only recv)
    --no-retransmit
```
