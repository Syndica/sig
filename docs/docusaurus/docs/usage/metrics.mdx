Sig also has a metric server to monitor activity.

## Setup 

requirements: 
- `docker compose` 
- Either MacOS or Linux supported 

modify `/etc/hosts` to include the following line: 
```
127.0.0.1 prometheus
```

## Running

- Mac: `docker compose -f compose-mac.yaml up -d`
- Linux: `docker compose -f compose-linux.yaml up -d`

--- 

- Grafana will be accessible on `localhost:3000`
- Prometheus will be accessible on `localhost:9090`
- Sig metrics will be published to `localhost:12345` (if you change this on the sig cli, you will 
need to also modify the prometheus `target` to point to the different port).

## Shutting down

- mac: `docker compose -f compose-mac.yaml down`
- linux: `docker compose -f compose-linux.yaml down`

[_compose.yaml_](https://github.com/Syndica/sig/blob/main/prometheus-grafana/compose-linux.yaml)
```
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ...
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ...
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

The compose file defines a stack with two services `prometheus` and `grafana`.

Make sure the ports 9090 and 3000 on the host are not already in use.
