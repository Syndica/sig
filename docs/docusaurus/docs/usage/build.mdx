## Dependencies

The only dependency for this project is:

- Zig 0.13.0: [Binary Releases](https://ziglang.org/download/)

## Build Commands

To build all binaries in the project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# debug mode
zig build
```

or

```bash
# for proudction
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Then run the binary you want to use:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/sig --help
```

These commands can also be done in one line:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe sig -- --help
```

## Binaries

The project includes the following binaries:
- `sig` - the main validator binary for the project
- `test` - the test binary for the project
- `fuzz` - the fuzzing binary for the project
- `benchmark` - the benchmarking binary for the project
- `geyser` - the binary for the geyser related functions

The exact build commands for each binary can be found in the `build.zig` file.

## Tips

To reduce build times you can specify the binary you want to build (the other binaries will not be
built):

```bash
zig build test
```

If you prefer to only build the binary (and not run it) you can use the `-Dno-run` option:

```bash
zig build -Dno-run fuzz
# ./zig-out/bin/fuzz exists
```

See the `build.zig` file for more build options.
