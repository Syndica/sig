# using vscode with sig unit tests 

move the two files in (`docs/files/`) to the `.vscode` folder in root: 
- `launch.json`
- `tasks.json`
add breakpoints and everything should work as normal in vscode

# open file limits on macOS

accounts-db opens many account files which requires admin changes to the machine - these are some resources to help:

Based on the above resources and individual testing, we concluded that to increase the number of open file descriptors and vnodes until next reboot, one must run:
1. `ulimit -Sn 100100100`
2. `sudo sysctl kern.maxvnodes=100100100`: warning, this has been known to crash when the SystemFdQuotaExceeded error would have been issues otherwise
3. `sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=100100100`
4. `sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=100100100`
